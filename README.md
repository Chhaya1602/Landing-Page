#Landing Page of Hospital 
In this project I created, A default medical landing page has a clean layout with a straightforward design. 
The appointment booking form is kept at the top, and other quick contact informationis placed right below the header section. 
Hence, new users with needs can contact you quickly. 
All elements work perfectly from the front-end side.

Landing Page means :A landing page is a standalone web page specifically designed for marketing or advertising campaigns, where visitors “land” after clicking on a link in an email, 
or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web.
